The script 'main.m' implements the Monty Hall problem in MATLAB. The script can also be run using the open source GNU Octave. The program supports any user-defined integer number of doors. Statistical clarity can be obtained by running 
a large number of simulations or instances of the game. This is also supported in the script. 

The number of doors and the number of simulations correspond to the variables 'N_doors' and 'N_sims' respectively. 

Implementations in other languages coming soon...
